.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBmpv\fP is a movie player based on MPlayer and mplayer2. It supports a wide variety of video
file formats, audio and video codecs, and subtitle types. Special input URL
types are available to read input from a variety of sources other than disk
files. Depending on platform, a variety of different video and audio output
methods are supported.
.sp
Usage examples to get you started quickly can be found at the end of this man
page.
.SH INTERACTIVE CONTROL
.sp
mpv has a fully configurable, command\-driven control layer which allows you

.SH USAGE
.sp
Every \fIflag\fP option has a \fIno\-flag\fP counterpart, e.g. the opposite of the
\fB\-\-fs\fP option is \fB\-\-no\-fs\fP. \fB\-\-fs=yes\fP is same as \fB\-\-fs\fP, \fB\-\-fs=no\fP
is the same as \fB\-\-no\-fs\fP.
.sp
If an option is marked as \fI(XXX only)\fP, it will only work in combination with
the \fIXXX\fP option or if \fIXXX\fP is compiled in.
.nf
\fINOTE\fP: The suboption parser (used for example for \fB\-\-ao=pcm\fP suboptions)
supports a special kind of string\-escaping intended for use with external
GUIs.
It has the following format:
%n%string_of_length_n
.fi
.sp
.nf
\fIEXAMPLES\fP:
\fImpv \-\-ao=pcm:file=%10%C:test.wav test.avi\fP
Or in a script:
\fImpv \-\-ao=pcm:file=%\(gaexpr length "$NAME"\(ga%"$NAME" test.avi\fP
.fi
.sp
.SS Per\-file options
.sp
When playing multiple files, any option given on the command line usually
affects all files. Example:
.sp
\fImpv \-\-a file1.mkv \-\-b file2.mkv \-\-c\fP
.TS
center;
|l|l|.
_
T{
File
T}  T{

\-\-a \-\-b \-\-c
T}
_
T{
file2.mkv
T}	T{
\-\-a \-\-b \-\-c
T}
_
.TE
.sp
Also, if any option is changed at runtime (via input commands), they aren\(aqt
reset when a new file is played.
.sp
Sometimes, it\(aqs useful to change options per\-file. This can be achieved by
adding the special per\-file markers \fI\-\-{\fP and \fI\-\-}\fP. (Note that you must
escape these on some shells.) Example:
.sp
\fImpv \-\-a file1.mkv \-\-b \-\-\e{ \-\-c file2.mkv \-\-d file3.mkv \-\-e \-\-\e} file4.mkv \-\-f\fP
.TS
center;
|l|l|.

T}
_
T{
file4.mkv
T}	T{
\-\-a \-\-b \-\-f
T}
_
.TE
.sp
Additionally, any file\-local option changed at runtime is reset when the current
file stops playing. If option \fB\-\-c\fP is changed during playback of \fIfile2.mkv\fP,
it\(aqs reset when advancing to \fIfile3.mkv\fP. This only affects file\-local options.
The option \fB\-\-a\fP is never reset here.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
.SS Location and syntax
.sp
You can put all of the options in configuration files which will be read every
time mpv is run. The system\-wide configuration file \(aqmpv.conf\(aq is in
your configuration directory (e.g. \fB/etc/mpv\fP or
\fB/usr/local/etc/mpv\fP), the user specific one is \fB~/.mpv/config\fP.
User specific options override system\-wide options and options given on the
command line override either. The syntax of the configuration files is
\fBoption=<value>\fP, everything after a \fI#\fP is considered a comment. Options
that work without values can be enabled by setting them to \fIyes\fP and disabled by
setting them to \fIno\fP. Even suboptions can be specified in this way.
.sp
\fIEXAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILE:\fP
.nf
# Use opengl video output by default.
vo=opengl
# Use quotes for text that can contain spaces:
status\-msg="Time: ${time\-pos}"
.fi
.sp
.SS Putting command line options into the configuration file
.sp
Almost all command line options can be put into the configuration file. Here
is a small guide:

.TE
.SS File specific configuration files
.sp
You can also write file\-specific configuration files. If you wish to have a
configuration file for a file called \(aqmovie.avi\(aq, create a file named
\(aqmovie.avi.conf\(aq with the file\-specific options in it and put it in
\fB~/.mpv/\fP. You can also put the configuration file in the same directory
as the file to be played, as long as you give the \fB\-\-use\-filedir\-conf\fP
option (either on the command line or in your global config file). If a
file\-specific configuration file is found in the same directory, no
file\-specific configuration is loaded from \fB~/.mpv\fP. In addition, the
\fB\-\-use\-filedir\-conf\fP option enables directory\-specific configuration files.
For this, mpv first tries to load a mpv.conf from the same directory
as the file played and then tries to load any file\-specific configuration.
.SS Profiles
.sp
To ease working with different configurations profiles can be defined in the
configuration files. A profile starts with its name between square brackets,
e.g. \fI[my\-profile]\fP. All following options will be part of the profile. A
description (shown by \fB\-\-profile=help\fP) can be defined with the profile\-desc
option. To end the profile, start another one or use the profile name
\fIdefault\fP to continue with normal options.
.sp
\fIEXAMPLE MPV PROFILE:\fP
.nf
[vo.vdpau]
# Use hardware decoding (this might break playback of some h264 files)
hwdec=vdpau

[protocol.dvd]

.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-abs\fB= <value>
(\fB\-\-ao=oss\fP only) (OBSOLETE)
Override audio driver/card buffer size detection.
.TP
.BI \-\-ad\fB= <[+|\-]family1:(*|decoder1),[+|\-]family2:(*|decoder2),...[\-]>
Specify a priority list of audio decoders to be used, according to their
family and decoder name. Entries like \fBfamily:*\fP prioritize all decoders
of the given family. When determining which decoder to use, the first
decoder that matches the audio format is selected. If that is unavailable,
the next decoder is used. Finally, it tries all other decoders that are not
explicitly selected or rejected by the option.
.sp
\fB\-\fP at the end of the list suppresses fallback to other available
decoders not on the \fB\-\-ad\fP list. \fB+\fP in front of an entry forces the
decoder. Both of these shouldn\(aqt normally be used, because they break
normal decoder auto\-selection!
.sp
\fB\-\fP in front of an entry disables selection of the decoder.
.sp
\fIEXAMPLE\fP:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-ad=lavc:mp3float\fP
Prefer the FFmpeg/Libav \fBmp3float\fP decoder over all other mp3
decoders.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-ad=spdif:ac3,lavc:*\fP
Always prefer spdif AC3 over FFmpeg/Libav over anything else.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-ad=help\fP
List all available decoders.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.BI \-\-ad\-lavc\-ac3drc\fB= <level>
Select the Dynamic Range Compression level for AC\-3 audio streams. <level>
is a float value ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 means no compression and 1
(which is the default) means full compression (make loud passages more
silent and vice versa). Values up to 2 are also accepted, but are purely
experimental. This option only shows an effect if the AC\-3 stream contains
the required range compression information.
.TP
.BI \-\-ad\-lavc\-downmix\fB= <yes|no>
Whether to request audio channel downmixing from the decoder (default: yes).
Some decoders, like AC\-3, AAC and DTS, can remix audio on decoding. The
requested number of output channels is set with the \fB\-\-channels\fP option.
Useful for playing surround audio on a stereo system.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-ad\-lavc\-o=<key>=<value>[,<key>=<value>[,...]]
Pass AVOptions to libavcodec decoder. Note, a patch to make the o=
unneeded and pass all unknown options through the AVOption system is
welcome. A full list of AVOptions can be found in the FFmpeg manual.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-af\fB= <filter1[=parameter1:parameter2:...],filter2,...>
Specify a list of audio filters to apply to the audio stream. See
\fIaudio_filters\fP for details and descriptions of the available filters.
The option variants \fB\-\-af\-add\fP, \fB\-\-af\-pre\fP, \fB\-\-af\-del\fP and
\fB\-\-af\-clr\fP exist to modify a previously specified list, but you
shouldn\(aqt need these for typical use.
.TP
.BI \-\-aid\fB= <ID|auto|no>
Select audio channel. \fBauto\fP selects the default, \fBno\fP disables audio.
See also \fB\-\-alang\fP.
.TP
.BI \-\-alang\fB= <languagecode[,languagecode,...]>
Specify a priority list of audio languages to use. Different container
formats employ different language codes. DVDs use ISO 639\-1 two letter
language codes, Matroska, MPEG\-TS and NUT use ISO 639\-2 three letter
language codes while OGM uses a free\-form identifier. mpv prints the
available languages when run in verbose (\fB\-v\fP) mode. See also \fB\-\-aid\fP.
.sp
\fIEXAMPLE\fP:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBmpv dvd://1 \-\-alang=hu,en\fP
Chooses the Hungarian language track on a DVD and falls back on
English if Hungarian is not available.
.TP
.B \fBmpv \-\-alang=jpn example.mkv\fP
Plays a Matroska file in Japanese.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.BI \-\-ao\fB= <driver1[:suboption1[=value]:...],driver2,...[,]>
Specify a priority list of audio output drivers to be used. For
interactive use you\(aqd normally specify a single one to use, but in
configuration files specifying a list of fallbacks may make sense. See
\fIaudio_outputs\fP for details and descriptions of available drivers.
.TP
.BI \-\-aspect\fB= <ratio>
Override movie aspect ratio, in case aspect information is incorrect or
missing in the file being played. See also \fB\-\-no\-aspect\fP.
.sp
\fIEXAMPLE\fP:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-aspect=4:3\fP  or \fB\-\-aspect=1.3333\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-aspect=16:9\fP or \fB\-\-aspect=1.7777\fP
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \-\-ass,  \-\-no\-ass
Render ASS subtitles natively, and convert text subtitles in other formats
to ASS internally (enabled by default).
.sp
If \fB\-\-no\-ass\fP is specified, all subtitles are converted to plain text
internally. All tags and style declarations are stripped and ignored. The
subtitle renderer uses the font style as specified by the \fB\-\-sub\-text\-\fP
options instead.
.sp
\fINOTE\fP: Using \fB\-\-no\-ass\fP may lead to incorrect or completely broken
rendering of ASS/SSA subtitles. It can sometimes be useful to forcibly
override the styling of ASS subtitles, but should be avoided in general.
.TP
.BI \-\-ass\-force\-style\fB= <[Style.]Param=Value[,...]>
Override some style or script info parameters.
.sp
\fIEXAMPLE\fP:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-ass\-force\-style=FontName=Arial,Default.Bold=1\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-ass\-force\-style=PlayResY=768\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fINOTE\fP: Using this option may lead to incorrect subtitle rendering.
.TP
.BI \-\-ass\-hinting\fB= <type>
Set hinting type. <type> can be:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B 0
no hinting
.TP
.B 1
FreeType autohinter, light mode
.TP
.B 2
FreeType autohinter, normal mode
.TP
.B 3
font native hinter
.UNINDENT
.sp
The default value is 0 (no hinting).
.TP
.BI \-\-ass\-line\-spacing\fB= <value>
Set line spacing value for SSA/ASS renderer.
.TP
.BI \-\-ass\-styles\fB= <filename>
Load all SSA/ASS styles found in the specified file and use them for
rendering text subtitles. The syntax of the file is exactly like the \fB[V4
Styles]\fP / \fB[V4+ Styles]\fP section of SSA/ASS.
.sp
\fINOTE\fP: Using this option may lead to incorrect subtitle rendering.
.TP
.BI \-\-ass\-style\-override\fB= <yes|no>
Control whether user style overrides should be applied.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B yes
Apply all the \fB\-\-ass\-*\fP style override options. Changing the default
for any of these options can lead to incorrect subtitle rendering.
(Default.)
.TP
.B no
Render subtitles as forced by subtitle scripts.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \-\-ass\-use\-margins
Enables placing toptitles and subtitles in black borders when they are
available.
.TP
.B \-\-ass\-vsfilter\-aspect\-compat
Stretch SSA/ASS subtitles when playing anamorphic videos for compatibility
with traditional VSFilter behavior. This switch has no effect when the
video is stored with square pixels.
.sp
The renderer historically most commonly used for the SSA/ASS subtitle
formats, VSFilter, had questionable behavior that resulted in subtitles
being stretched too if the video was stored in anamorphic format that
required scaling for display.  This behavior is usually undesirable and
newer VSFilter versions may behave differently. However, many existing
scripts compensate for the stretching by modifying things in the opposite
direction.  Thus if such scripts are displayed "correctly" they will not
appear as intended.  This switch enables emulation of the old VSFilter
behavior (undesirable but expected by many existing scripts).
.sp
Enabled by default.
.TP
.BI \-\-audio\-demuxer\fB= <[+]name>
Force audio demuxer type when using \fB\-\-audiofile\fP. Use a \(aq+\(aq before the
name to force it, this will skip some checks! Give the demuxer name as
printed by \fB\-\-audio\-demuxer=help\fP. \fB\-\-audio\-demuxer=audio\fP forces MP3.
.TP
.BI \-\-audio\-display\fB= <no|attachment>
Setting this option to \fBattachment\fP (default) will display image
attachments when playing audio files. It will display the first image
found, and additional images are available as video streams.
.sp
Setting this option to \fBno\fP disables display of video entirely when
playing audio files.
.sp
This option has no influence on files with normal video tracks.
.TP
.BI \-\-audiofile\fB= <filename>
Play audio from an external file (WAV, MP3 or Ogg Vorbis) while viewing a
movie.
.TP
.BI \-\-audiofile\-cache\fB= <kBytes>
Enables caching for the stream used by \fB\-\-audiofile\fP, using the
specified amount of memory.
.TP
.BI \-\-autofit\fB= <[W[xH]]>
Set the initial window size to a maximum size specified by WxH, without
changing the window\(aqs aspect ratio. The size is measured in pixels, or if
a number is followed by a percentage sign (\fB%\fP), in percents of the
screen size.
.sp
This option never changes the aspect ratio of the window. If the aspect
ratio mismatches, the window\(aqs size is reduced until it fits into the
specified size.
.sp
Window position is not taken into account, nor is it modified by this
option (the window manager still may place the window differently depending
on size). Use \fB\-\-geometry\fP to change the window position. Its effects
are applied after this option.
.sp
See \fB\-\-geometry\fP for details how this is handled with multi\-monitor
setups.
.sp
Use \fB\-\-autofit\-larger\fP instead if you don\(aqt want the window to get larger.
Use \fB\-\-geometry\fP if you want to force both window width and height to a
specific size.
.sp
\fINOTE\fP: Generally only supported by GUI VOs. Ignored for encoding.
.sp
\fIEXAMPLE\fP:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB70%\fP
Make the window width 70% of the screen size, keeping aspect ratio.
.TP
.B \fB1000\fP
Set the window width to 1000 pixels, keeping aspect ratio.
.TP
.B \fB70%:60%\fP
Make the window as large as possible, without being wider than 70% of
the screen width, or higher than 60% of the screen height.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.BI \-\-autofit\-larger\fB= <[W[xH]]>
This option behaves exactly like \fB\-\-autofit\fP, except the window size is
only changed if the window would be larger than the specified size.
.sp
\fIEXAMPLE\fP:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB90%x80%\fP
If the video is larger than 90% of the screen width or 80% of the
screen height, make the window smaller until either its width is 90%
of the screen, or its height is 80% of the screen.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \-\-autosub,  \-\-no\-autosub
Load additional subtitle files matching the video filename. Enabled by
default. See also \fB\-\-autosub\-match\fP.
.TP
.BI \-\-autosub\-match\fB= <exact|fuzzy|all>
Adjust matching fuzziness when searching for subtitles:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B exact

.TP
.B fuzzy
Load all subs containing movie name.
.TP
.B all
Load all subs in the current and \fB\-\-sub\-paths\fP directories.
.UNINDENT
.sp
(Default: exact.)
.TP
.BI \-\-autosync\fB= <factor>
Gradually adjusts the A/V sync based on audio delay measurements.
Specifying \fB\-\-autosync=0\fP, the default, will cause frame timing to be
based entirely on audio delay measurements. Specifying \fB\-\-autosync=1\fP
will do the same, but will subtly change the A/V correction algorithm. An
uneven video framerate in a movie which plays fine with \fB\-\-no\-audio\fP can
often be helped by setting this to an integer value greater than 1. The
higher the value, the closer the timing will be to \fB\-\-no\-audio\fP. Try
\fB\-\-autosync=30\fP to smooth out problems with sound drivers which do not
implement a perfect audio delay measurement. With this value, if large A/V
sync offsets occur, they will only take about 1 or 2 seconds to settle
out. This delay in reaction time to sudden A/V offsets should be the only
side\-effect of turning this option on, for all sound drivers.
.TP
.BI \-\-bandwidth\fB= <Bytes>
Specify the maximum bandwidth for network streaming (for servers that are
able to send content in different bitrates). Useful if you want to watch
live streamed media behind a slow connection. With Real RTSP streaming, it
is also used to set the maximum delivery bandwidth allowing faster cache
filling and stream dumping.
.sp
\fINOTE\fP: probably broken/useless.
.TP
.B \-\-untimed
Do not sleep when outputting video frames. Useful for benchmarks when used
with \-\-no\-audio.
.TP
.BI \-\-bluray\-angle\fB= <ID>
Some Blu\-ray discs contain scenes that can be viewed from multiple angles.
Here you can tell mpv which angles to use (default: 1).
.TP
.BI \-\-bluray\-device\fB= <path>
(Blu\-ray only)
Specify the Blu\-ray disc location. Must be a directory with Blu\-ray
structure.
.TP
.B \-\-border,  \-\-no\-border
Play movie with window border and decorations. Since this is on by
default, use \fB\-\-no\-border\fP to disable the standard window decorations.
.TP
.BI \-\-brightness\fB= <\-100\-100>
Adjust the brightness of the video signal (default: 0). Not supported by
all video output drivers.
.TP
.BI \-\-cache\fB= <kBytes>
Enable caching of the input stream (if not already enabled) and set the
size of the cache in kilobytes. Caching is enabled by default (with a
default cache size) for network streams. May be useful when playing files
from slow media, but can also have negative effects, especially with file
formats that require a lot of seeking, such as mp4. See also \fB\-\-no\-cache\fP.
.sp
Note that half the cache size will be used to allow fast seeking back. This
is also the reason why a full cache is usually reported as 50% full. The
cache fill display does not include the part of the cache reserved for
seeking back. Likewise, when starting a file the cache will be at 100%,
because no space is reserved for seeking back yet.
.TP
.BI \-\-cache\-pause\fB= <no|percentage>
If the cache percentage goes below the specified value, pause and wait
until the percentage set by \fB\-\-cache\-min\fP is reached, then resume
playback (default: 10). If \fBno\fP is specified, this behavior is disabled.
.sp
When the player is paused this way, the status line shows \fBBuffering\fP
instead of \fBPaused\fP, and the OSD uses a clock symbol instead of the
normal paused symbol.
.TP
.BI \-\-cache\-min\fB= <percentage>
Playback will start when the cache has been filled up to <percentage> of
the total (default: 20).
.TP
.BI \-\-cache\-seek\-min\fB= <percentage>
If a seek is to be made to a position within <percentage> of the cache
size from the current position, mpv will wait for the cache to be
filled to this position rather than performing a stream seek (default:
50).
.TP
.BI \-\-cdda\fB= <option1:option2>
This option can be used to tune the CD Audio reading feature of mpv.
.sp
Available options are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B speed=<value>
Set CD spin speed.
.TP
.B paranoia=<0\-2>
Set paranoia level. Values other than 0 seem to break playback of
anything but the first track.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B 0
disable checking (default)
.TP
.B 1
overlap checking only
.TP
.B 2

.UNINDENT
.TP
.B generic\-dev=<value>
Use specified generic SCSI device.
.TP
.B sector\-size=<value>
Set atomic read size.
.TP
.B overlap=<value>
Force minimum overlap search during verification to <value> sectors.
.TP
.B toc\-bias
Assume that the beginning offset of track 1 as reported in the TOC
will be addressed as LBA 0. Some Toshiba drives need this for getting
track boundaries correct.
.TP
.B toc\-offset=<value>
Add <value> sectors to the values reported when addressing tracks. May
be negative.
.TP
.B (no\-)skip
(Never) accept imperfect data reconstruction.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.BI \-\-cdrom\-device\fB= <path>
Specify the CD\-ROM device (default: \fB/dev/cdrom\fP).
.TP
.BI \-\-channels\fB= <number|layout>
Request the number of playback channels (default: 2). mpv asks the
decoder to decode the audio into as many channels as specified. Then it is
up to the decoder to fulfill the requirement. This is usually only
important when playing videos with AC\-3, AAC or DTS audio. In that case
libavcodec downmixes the audio into the requested number of channels if
possible.
.sp
\fINOTE\fP: This option is honored by codecs (AC\-3 only), filters (surround)
and audio output drivers (OSS at least).
.sp
The \fB\-\-channels\fP option either takes a channel number or an explicit
channel layout. Channel numbers refer to default layouts, e.g. 2 channels
refer to stereo, 6 refers to 5.1.
.sp
See \fB\-\-channels=help\fP output for defined default layouts. This also
lists speaker names, which can be used to express arbitrary channel
layouts (e.g. \fBfl\-fr\-lfe\fP is 2.1).
.TP
.BI \-\-chapter\fB= <start[\-end]>
Specify which chapter to start playing at. Optionally specify which
chapter to end playing at. Also see \fB\-\-start\fP.
.TP
.BI \-\-chapter\-merge\-threshold\fB= <number>
Threshold for merging almost consecutive ordered chapter parts in
milliseconds (default: 100). Some Matroska files with ordered chapters
have inaccurate chapter end timestamps, causing a small gap between the
end of one chapter and the start of the next one when they should match.
If the end of one playback part is less than the given threshold away from
the start of the next one then keep playing video normally over the
chapter change instead of doing a seek.
.TP
.BI \-\-colormatrix\fB= <colorspace>
Controls the YUV to RGB color space conversion when playing video. There
are various standards. Normally, BT.601 should be used for SD video, and
BT.709 for HD video. (This is done by default.) Using incorrect color space
results in slightly under or over saturated and shifted colors.
.sp
The color space conversion is additionally influenced by the related
options \-\-colormatrix\-input\-range and \-\-colormatrix\-output\-range.
.sp
These options are not always supported. Different video outputs provide
varying degrees of support. The opengl and vdpau video output drivers usually
offer full support. The xv output can set the color space if the system
video driver supports it, but not input and output levels. The scale video
filter can configure color space and input levels, but only if the output
format is RGB (if the video output driver supports RGB output, you can
force this with \fB\-vf scale,format=rgba\fP).
.sp
If this option is set to \fBauto\fP (which is the default), the video\(aqs
color space flag will be used. If that flag is unset, the color space
will be selected automatically. This is done using a simple heuristic that
attempts to distinguish SD and HD video. If the video is larger than
1279x576 pixels, BT.709 (HD) will be used; otherwise BT.601 (SD) is
selected.
.sp
Available color spaces are:
.INDENT 7.0

.BI \-\-colormatrix\-input\-range\fB= <color\-range>
YUV color levels used with YUV to RGB conversion. This option is only
necessary when playing broken files, which don\(aqt follow standard color
levels or which are flagged wrong. If the video doesn\(aqt specify its
color range, it is assumed to be limited range.
.sp
The same limitations as with \-\-colormatrix apply.
.sp
Available color ranges are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B auto
automatic selection (normally limited range) (default)

.UNINDENT
.TP
.BI \-\-colormatrix\-output\-range\fB= <color\-range>
RGB color levels used with YUV to RGB conversion. Normally, output devices
such as PC monitors use full range color levels. However, some TVs and
video monitors expect studio level RGB. Providing full range output to a
device expecting studio level input results in crushed blacks and whites,
the reverse in dim grey blacks and dim whites.
.sp
The same limitations as with \-\-colormatrix apply.
.sp
Available color ranges are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B auto

.UNINDENT
.TP
.BI \-\-colorkey\fB= <number>
Changes the colorkey to an RGB value of your choice. 0x000000 is black and
0xffffff is white. Only supported by the xv (see \fB\-\-vo=xv:ck\fP) video
output driver. See also \fB\-\-no\-colorkey\fP.
.TP
.B \-\-consolecontrols,  \-\-no\-consolecontrols
\fB\-\-no\-consolecontrols\fP prevents the player from reading key events from
standard input. Useful when reading data from standard input. This is
automatically enabled when \fB\-\fP is found on the command line. There are
situations where you have to set it manually, e.g. if you open
\fB/dev/stdin\fP (or the equivalent on your system), use stdin in a playlist
or intend to read from stdin later on via the loadfile or loadlist slave
commands.
.TP
.BI \-\-contrast\fB= <\-100\-100>
Adjust the contrast of the video signal (default: 0). Not supported by all
video output drivers.
.TP
.B \-\-cookies,  \-\-no\-cookies
(network only)
Support cookies when making HTTP requests. Disabled by default.
.TP
.BI \-\-cookies\-file\fB= <filename>
(network only)
Read HTTP cookies from <filename>. The file is
assumed to be in Netscape format.
.TP
.B \-\-correct\-pts,  \-\-no\-correct\-pts
Switches mpv to a mode where timestamps for video frames are
calculated differently and video filters which add new frames or modify
timestamps of existing ones are supported. Now enabled automatically for
most common file formats. The more accurate timestamps can be visible for
example when playing subtitles timed to scene changes with the \fB\-\-ass\fP
option. Without \fB\-\-correct\-pts\fP the subtitle timing will typically be
off by some frames. This option does not work correctly with some demuxers
and codecs.
.TP
.BI \-\-cursor\-autohide\fB= <number|no|always>
Make mouse cursor automatically hide after given number of milliseconds.
\fBno\fP will disable cursor autohide. \fBalways\fP means the cursor
will stay hidden. Supported by video output drivers which use X11 or
OS X Cocoa.
.TP
.BI \-\-audio\-delay\fB= <sec>
audio delay in seconds (positive or negative float value). Negative values
delay the audio, and positive values delay the video.
.TP
.BI \-\-demuxer\fB= <[+]name>
Force demuxer type. Use a \(aq+\(aq before the name to force it, this will skip
some checks! Give the demuxer name as printed by \fB\-\-demuxer=help\fP.
.TP
.BI \-\-doubleclick\-time\fB= <milliseconds>
Time in milliseconds to recognize two consecutive button presses as a
double\-click (default: 300).
.TP
.B \-\-dtshd,  \-\-no\-dtshd
When using DTS passthrough, output any DTS\-HD track as\-is.
With \fB\-\-no\-dtshd\fP (the default) only the DTS Core parts will be output.
.sp
DTS\-HD tracks can be sent over HDMI but not over the original
coax/toslink S/PDIF system.
.TP
.BI \-\-dvbin\fB= <options>
Pass the following parameters to the DVB input module, in order to
override the default ones:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B card=<1\-4>
Specifies using card number 1\-4 (default: 1).
.TP
.B file=<filename>
Instructs mpv to read the channels list from
<filename>. Default is
\fB~/.mpv/channels.conf.{sat,ter,cbl,atsc}\fP (based
on your card type) or \fB~/.mpv/channels.conf\fP as a
last resort.
.TP
.B timeout=<1\-30>
Maximum number of seconds to wait when trying to tune a
frequency before giving up (default: 30).
.UNINDENT
.TP
.BI \-\-dvd\-device\fB= <path>
Specify the DVD device or .iso filename (default: \fB/dev/dvd\fP). You can
also specify a directory that contains files previously copied directly
from a DVD (with e.g. vobcopy).
.TP
.BI \-\-dvd\-speed\fB= <speed>
Try to limit DVD speed (default: 0, no change). DVD base speed is 1385
kB/s, so a 8x drive can read at speeds up to 11080 kB/s. Slower speeds
make the drive more quiet. For watching DVDs 2700 kB/s should be quiet and
fast enough. mpv resets the speed to the drive default value on close.
Values of at least 100 mean speed in kB/s. Values less than 100 mean
multiples of 1385 kB/s, i.e. \fB\-\-dvd\-speed=8\fP selects 11080 kB/s.
.sp
\fINOTE\fP: You need write access to the DVD device to change the speed.
.TP
.BI \-\-dvdangle\fB= <ID>
Some DVD discs contain scenes that can be viewed from multiple angles.
Here you can tell mpv which angles to use (default: 1).
.TP
.BI \-\-edition\fB= <ID>
(Matroska files only)
Specify the edition (set of chapters) to use, where 0 is the first. If set
to \-1 (the default), mpv will choose the first edition declared as a
default, or if there is no default, the first edition defined.
.TP
.B \-\-embeddedfonts,  \-\-no\-embeddedfonts
Use fonts embedded in Matroska container files and ASS scripts (default:
enabled). These fonts can be used for SSA/ASS subtitle rendering
(\fB\-\-ass\fP option).
.TP
.BI \-\-end\fB= <time>
Stop at given absolute time. Use \fB\-\-length\fP if the time should be relative
to \fB\-\-start\fP. See \fB\-\-start\fP for valid option values and examples.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-extbased,  \-\-extbased
\fB\-\-no\-extbased\fP disables extension\-based demuxer selection. By default, when the file type
(demuxer) cannot be detected reliably (the file has no header or it is not
reliable enough), the filename extension is used to select the demuxer.
Always falls back on content\-based demuxer selection.
.TP
.BI \-\-field\-dominance\fB= <auto|top|bottom>
Set first field for interlaced content. Useful for deinterlacers that
double the framerate: \fB\-\-vf=yadif=1\fP and \fB\-\-vo=vdpau:deint\fP.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B auto
(default) If the decoder does not export the appropriate

.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \-\-no\-fixed\-vo,  \-\-fixed\-vo
\fB\-\-no\-fixed\-vo\fP enforces closing and reopening the video window for
multiple files (one (un)initialization for all files).
.TP
.B \-\-flip
Flip image upside\-down.
.TP
.B \-\-force\-rgba\-osd\-rendering
Change how some video outputs render the OSD and text subtitles. This
does not change appearance of the subtitles and only has performance
implications. For VOs which support native ASS rendering (like \fBvdpau\fP,
\fBopengl\fP, \fBdirect3d\fP), this can be slightly faster or slower,
depending on GPU drivers and hardware. For other VOs, this just makes
rendering slower.
.TP
.B \-\-force\-window\-position
Forcefully move mpv\(aqs video output window to default location whenever
there is a change in video parameters, video stream or file. This used to
be the default behavior. Currently only affects X11 VOs.
.TP
.B \-\-sub\-forced\-only
Display only forced subtitles for the DVD subtitle stream selected by e.g.
\fB\-\-slang\fP.
.TP
.B \-\-forceidx
Force index rebuilding. Useful for files with broken index (A/V desync,
etc). This will enable seeking in files where seeking was not possible.
.sp
\fINOTE\fP: This option only works if the underlying media supports seeking
(i.e. not with stdin, pipe, etc).
.TP
.BI \-\-format\fB= <format>
Select the sample format used for output from the audio filter layer to
the sound card. The values that <format> can adopt are listed below in the
description of the \fBformat\fP audio filter.
.TP
.BI \-\-fps\fB= <float>
Override video framerate. Useful if the original value is wrong or missing.
.sp
\fINOTE\fP: Works in \fB\-\-no\-correct\-pts\fP mode only.
.TP
.BI \-\-framedrop\fB= <no|yes|hard>
Skip displaying some frames to maintain A/V sync on slow systems. Video
filters are not applied to such frames. For B\-frames even decoding is
skipped completely. May produce unwatchably choppy output. With \fBhard\fP,
decoding and output of any frame can be skipped, and will lead to an even
worse playback experience.
.sp
\fINOTE\fP: Practical use of this feature is questionable. Disabled by default.
.TP
.BI \-\-frames\fB= <number>
Play/convert only first <number> video frames, then quit. For audio only,
run <number> iteration of the playback loop, which is most likely not what
you want. (This behavior also applies to the corner case when there are
less video frames than <number>, and audio is longer than the video.)
.TP
.B \-\-fullscreen,  \-\-fs
Fullscreen playback (centers movie, and paints black bands around it).
.TP
.BI \-\-fs\-screen\fB= <all|current|0\-32>
In multi\-monitor configurations (i.e. a single desktop that spans across
multiple displays) this option tells mpv which screen to go fullscreen to.
If \fBdefault\fP is provided mpv will fallback to using the behaviour
depending on what the user provided with the \fBscreen\fP option.
.sp
\fINOTE (X11)\fP: this option does not work properly with all window managers.
\fBall\fP in particular will usually only work with \fB\-\-fstype=\-fullscreen\fP
or \fB\-\-fstype=none\fP, and even then only with some window managers.

OBSOLETE, use the \fB\-\-fs\fP option.
Try this option if you still experience fullscreen problems.
.TP
.BI \-\-fstype\fB= <type1,type2,...>
(X11 only)
Specify a priority list of fullscreen modes to be used. You can negate the
modes by prefixing them with \(aq\-\(aq. If you experience problems like the
fullscreen window being covered by other windows try using a different
order.
.sp
\fINOTE\fP: See \fB\-\-fstype=help\fP for a full list of available modes.

.TP
.B \fB\-\-fstype=fullscreen\fP
Fixes fullscreen switching on OpenBox 1.x.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \-\-native\-fs
(OS X only)
Use OSX\(aqs Mission Control\(aqs fullscreen feature instead of the custom one
provided by mpv. This can potentially break a lot of stuff like
\fB\-\-geometry\fP and is disabled by default. On the other hand it provides
a more \(aqOS X\-like\(aq user experience.
.TP
.BI \-\-gamma\fB= <\-100\-100>
Adjust the gamma of the video signal (default: 0). Not supported by all
video output drivers.
.TP
.B \-\-gapless\-audio
Try to play consecutive audio files with no silence or disruption at the
point of file change. This feature is implemented in a simple manner and
relies on audio output device buffering to continue playback while moving
from one file to another. If playback of the new file starts slowly, for
example because it\(aqs played from a remote network location or because you
have specified cache settings that require time for the initial cache
fill, then the buffered audio may run out before playback of the new file
can start.
.sp
\fINOTE\fP: The audio device is opened using parameters chosen according to
the first file played and is then kept open for gapless playback. This
means that if the first file for example has a low samplerate then the
following files may get resampled to the same low samplerate, resulting in
reduced sound quality. If you play files with different parameters,
consider using options such as \fB\-\-srate\fP and \fB\-\-format\fP to explicitly
select what the shared output format will be.
.TP
.BI \-\-geometry\fB= <[W[xH]][+\-x+\-y]>, \ \-\-geometry\fB= <x:y>
Adjust the initial window position or size. W and H set the window size in
pixels. x and y set the window position, measured in pixels from the
top\-left of the screen to the top\-left of the image being displayed. If a
percentage sign (\fB%\fP) is given after the argument it turns the value into
a percentage of the screen size in that direction. Positions are specified
similar to the standard X11 \fB\-\-geometry\fP option format, in which e.g.
+10\-50 means "place 10 pixels from the left border and 50 pixels from the
lower border" and "\-\-20+\-10" means "place 20 pixels beyond the right and
10 pixels beyond the top border".
.sp
If an external window is specified using the \fB\-\-wid\fP option, this
option is ignored.
.sp
The coordinates are relative to the screen given with \fB\-\-screen\fP for the
video output drivers that fully support \fB\-\-screen\fP.
.sp
\fINOTE\fP: Generally only supported by GUI VOs. Ignored for encoding.
.sp
\fINOTE (OSX)\fP: On Mac OSX the origin of the screen coordinate system is
located on the the bottom\-left corner. For instance, \fB0:0\fP will place the
window at the bottom\-left of the screen.
.sp
\fINOTE (X11)\fP: this option does not work properly with all window managers.
.sp
\fIEXAMPLE\fP:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB50:40\fP
Places the window at x=50, y=40.
.TP
.B \fB50%:50%\fP
Places the window in the middle of the screen.
.TP
.B \fB100%:100%\fP
Places the window at the bottom right corner of the screen.
.TP
.B \fB50%\fP
Sets the window width to half the screen width. Window height is set so
that the window has the video aspect ratio.
.TP
.B \fB50%x50%\fP
Forces the window width and height to half the screen width and height.
Will show black borders to compensate for the video aspect ration (with
most VOs and without \fB\-\-no\-keepaspect\fP).
.TP
.B \fB50%+10+10\fP
Sets the window to half the screen widths, and positions it 10 pixels
below/left of the top left corner of the screen.
.UNINDENT
.sp
See also \fB\-\-autofit\fP and \fB\-\-autofit\-larger\fP for fitting the window into
a given size without changing aspect ratio.
.TP
.B \-\-grabpointer,  \-\-no\-grabpointer
\fB\-\-no\-grabpointer\fP tells the player to not grab the mouse pointer after a
video mode change (\fB\-\-vm\fP). Useful for multihead setups.
.TP
.B \-\-heartbeat\-cmd
Command that is executed every 30 seconds during playback via \fIsystem()\fP \-
i.e. using the shell. The time between the commands can be customized with
the \fB\-\-heartbeat\-interval\fP option.
.sp
\fINOTE\fP: mpv uses this command without any checking. It is your
responsibility to ensure it does not cause security problems (e.g. make
sure to use full paths if "." is in your path like on Windows). It also
only works when playing video (i.e. not with \fB\-\-no\-video\fP but works with
\fB\-vo=null\fP).
.sp
This can be "misused" to disable screensavers that do not support the
proper X API (see also \fB\-\-stop\-xscreensaver\fP). If you think this is too
complicated, ask the author of the screensaver program to support the
proper X APIs.

.BI \-\-heartbeat\-interval\fB= <sec>
Time between \fB\-\-heartbeat\-cmd\fP invocations in seconds (default: 30).
.TP
.B \-\-help
Show short summary of options.
.TP
.BI \-\-hr\-seek\fB= <no|absolute|yes>
Select when to use precise seeks that are not limited to keyframes. Such
seeks require decoding video from the previous keyframe up to the target
position and so can take some time depending on decoding performance. For
some video formats precise seeks are disabled. This option selects the
default choice to use for seeks; it\(aqs possible to explicitly override that
default in the definition of key bindings and in slave mode commands.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B no
Never use precise seeks.
.TP
.B absolute
Use precise seeks if the seek is to an absolute position in the

the default behavior of arrow keys (default).
.TP
.B yes
Use precise seeks whenever possible.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.BI \-\-hr\-seek\-demuxer\-offset\fB= <seconds>
This option exists to work around failures to do precise seeks (as in
\fB\-\-hr\-seek\fP) caused by bugs or limitations in the demuxers for some file
formats. Some demuxers fail to seek to a keyframe before the given target
position, going to a later position instead. The value of this option is
subtracted from the time stamp given to the demuxer. Thus if you set this
option to 1.5 and try to do a precise seek to 60 seconds, the demuxer is
told to seek to time 58.5, which hopefully reduces the chance that it
erroneously goes to some time later than 60 seconds. The downside of
setting this option is that precise seeks become slower, as video between
the earlier demuxer position and the real target may be unnecessarily
decoded.

.B \-\-idle
Makes mpv wait idly instead of quitting when there is no file to play.
Mostly useful in slave mode where mpv can be controlled through input
commands (see also \fB\-\-slave\-broken\fP).
.TP
.B \-\-idx
Rebuilds index of files if no index was found, allowing seeking. Useful
with broken/incomplete downloads, or badly created files. Now this is done
automatically by the demuxers used for most video formats, meaning that
this switch has no effect in the typical case. See also \fB\-\-forceidx\fP.
.sp
\fINOTE\fP: This option only works if the underlying media supports seeking
(i.e. not with stdin, pipe, etc).
.TP
.B \-\-ignore\-start
Matters with the builtin AVI demuxer only, which is not enabled by default.
Ignore the specified starting time for streams in AVI files. This
nullifies stream delays.
.TP
.BI \-\-include\fB= <configuration\-file>
Specify configuration file to be parsed after the default ones.
.TP
.B \-\-initial\-audio\-sync,  \-\-no\-initial\-audio\-sync
When starting a video file or after events such as seeking mpv will by
default modify the audio stream to make it start from the same timestamp
as video, by either inserting silence at the start or cutting away the
first samples. Disabling this option makes the player behave like older
mpv versions did: video and audio are both started immediately even if
their start timestamps differ, and then video timing is gradually adjusted
if necessary to reach correct synchronization later.

\fINOTE\fP: When the given file is a FIFO mpv opens both ends so you
can do several \fIecho "seek 10" > mp_pipe\fP and the pipe will stay

.B \-\-input\-test
Input test mode. Instead of executing commands on key presses, mpv
will show the keys and the bound commands on the OSD. Has to be used
with a dummy video, and the normal ways to quit the player will not
work (key bindings that normally quit will be shown on OSD only, just
like any other binding).

(Ignored in fullscreen mode.)
.TP
.B \-\-keep\-open
Do not terminate when playing or seeking beyond the end of the file.
Instead, pause the player. When trying to seek beyond end of the file, the
player will pause at an arbitrary playback position (or, in corner cases,
not redraw the window at all).
.sp
\fINOTE\fP: this option is not respected when using \fB\-\-frames\fP, \fB\-\-end\fP,
\fB\-\-length\fP, or when passing a chapter range to \fB\-\-chapter\fP. Explicitly

.BI \-\-key\-fifo\-size\fB= <2\-65000>
Specify the size of the FIFO that buffers key events (default: 7). If it
is too small some events may be lost. The main disadvantage of setting it
to a very large value is that if you hold down a key triggering some
particularly slow command then the player may be unresponsive while it
processes all the queued commands.

Skips the loop filter (AKA deblocking) during H.264 decoding. Since
the filtered frame is supposed to be used as reference for decoding

.B \-\-mkv\-subtitle\-preroll
Try harder to show embedded soft subtitles when seeking somewhere. Normally,
it can happen that the subtitle at the seek target is not shown due to how
some container file formats are designed. The subtitles appear only if
seeking before or exactly to the position a subtitle first appears. To
make this worse, subtitles are often timed to appear a very small amount
before the associated video frame, so that seeking to the video frame
typically does not demux the subtitle at that position.
.sp
Enabling this option makes the demuxer start reading data a bit before the
seek target, so that subtitles appear correctly. Note that this makes
seeking slower, and is not guaranteed to always work. It only works if the
subtitle is close enough to the seek target.
.sp
Works with the internal Matroska demuxer only. Always enabled for absolute
and hr\-seeks, and this option changes behavior with relative or imprecise
seeks only.
.sp
See also \fB\-\-hr\-seek\-demuxer\-offset\fP option. This option can achieve a
similar effect, but only if hr\-seek is active. It works with any demuxer,
but makes seeking much slower, as it has to decode audio and video data,
instead of just skipping over it.

stopped changing the filename with the \fBstream\-capture\fP slave property.
Generally this will not produce usable results for anything else than MPEG

.BI \-\-reset\-on\-next\-file\fB= <all|option1,option2,...>
Normally, mpv will try to keep all settings when playing the next file on
the playlist, even if they were changed by the user during playback. (This
behavior is the opposite of MPlayer\(aqs, which tries to reset all settings
when starting next file.)
.sp
This can be changed with this option. It accepts a list of options, and
mpv will reset the value of these options on playback start to the initial
value. The initial value is either the default value, or as set by the
config file or command line.
.sp
In some cases, this might not work as expected. For example, \fB\-\-volume\fP

.B \-\-save\-position\-on\-quit
Always save the current playback position on quit. When this file is
played again later, the player will seek to the old playback position on
start. This affects any form of stopping playback (quitting, going to the
next file).
.sp
This behavior is disabled by default, but is always available when quitting
the player with Shift+Q.

Set the PNG compression level. Higher means better compression. This will
affect the file size of the written screenshot file, and the time it takes
to write a screenshot. Too high compression might occupy enough CPU time to
interrupt playback. The default is 7.
.TP
.BI \-\-screenshot\-template\fB= <template>
Specify the filename template used to save screenshots. The template
specifies the filename without file extension, and can contain format
specifiers, which will be substituted when taking a screeshot.
By default the template is \fBshot%n\fP, which results in filenames like
\fBshot0012.png\fP for example.
.sp
The template can start with a relative or absolute path, in order to
specify a directory location where screenshots should be saved.
.sp
If the final screenshot filename points to an already existing file, the
file won\(aqt be overwritten. The screenshot will either not be saved, or if
the template contains \fB%n\fP, saved using different, newly generated
filename.

.B \fB%[#][0X]n\fP
A sequence number, padded with zeros to length X (default: 04). E.g.
passing the format \fB%04n\fP will yield \fB0012\fP on the 12th screenshot.
The number is incremented every time a screenshot is taken, or if the
file already exists. The length \fBX\fP must be in the range 0\-9. With
the optional # sign mpv will use the lowest available number. For
example, if you take three screenshots\-\-0001, 0002, 0003\-\-and delete
the first two, the next two screenshots won\(aqt be 0004 and 0005, but

Filename of the currently played video.
.TP
.B \fB%F\fP
Same as \fB%f\fP, but strip the file extension, including the dot.
.TP
.B \fB%p\fP
Current playback time, in the same format as used in the OSD. The
result is a string of the form "HH:MM:SS". For example, if the video is
at the time position 5 minutes and 34 seconds, \fB%p\fP will be replaced
with "00:05:34".
.TP
.B \fB%P\fP
Similar to \fB%p\fP, but extended with the playback time in milliseconds.
It is formatted as "HH:MM:SS.mmm", with "mmm" being the millisecond
part of the playback time. (Note that this is a simple way for getting
unique per\-frame timestamps. Frame numbers would be more intuitive, but
are not easily implementable, because container formats usually use
time stamps for identifying frames.)
.TP
.B \fB%tX\fP
Specify the current local date/time using the format \fBX\fP. This format
specifier uses the UNIX \fBstrftime()\fP function internally, and inserts
the result of passing "%X" to \fBstrftime\fP. For example, \fB%tm\fP will
insert the number of the current month as number. You have to use
multiple \fB%tX\fP specifiers to build a full date/time string.
.TP
.B \fB%{prop[:fallback text]}\fP
Insert the value of the slave property \(aqprop\(aq. E.g. \fB%{filename}\fP is
the same as \fB%f\fP. If the property doesn\(aqt exist or is not available,
an error text is inserted, unless a fallback is specified.

.B \-\-slave\-broken
Switches on the old slave mode. This is for testing only, and incompatible

.sp
\fINOTE\fP: Changes incompatible to slave mode applications have been made. In
particular, the status line output was changed, which is used by some
applications to determine the current playback position. This switch has
been renamed to prevent these applications from working with this version
of mpv, because it would lead to buggy and confusing behavior only.
Moreover, the slave mode protocol is so horribly bad that it should not be
used for new programs, nor should existing programs attempt to adapt to the
changed output and use the \-\-slave\-broken switch. Instead, a new, saner
protocol should be developed (and will, if there is enough interest).
.sp
This affects smplayer, smplayer2, mplayerosx, and others.
.TP
.B \-\-softsleep
Time frames by repeatedly checking the current time instead of asking
the kernel to wake up mpv at the correct time. Useful if your kernel
timing is imprecise and you cannot use the RTC either. Comes at the

.B xv (X11 only)
Uses the XVideo extension to enable hardware accelerated playback. This is
the most compatible VO on X, but may be low quality, and has issues with
OSD and subtitle display.
For information about what colorkey is used and how it is drawn run
mpv with \fB\-v\fP option and look out for the lines tagged with \fB[xv

Select the source from which the colorkey is taken (default: cur).
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B cur
The default takes the colorkey currently set in Xv.
.TP

Uses the VDPAU interface to display and optionally also decode video.
Hardware decoding is used with \fB\-\-hwdec=vdpau\fP.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B sharpen=<\-1\-1>
For positive values, apply a sharpening algorithm to the video, for
negative values a blurring algorithm (default: 0).
.TP
.B denoise=<0\-1>
Apply a noise reduction algorithm to the video (default: 0, no noise
reduction).
.TP
.B deint=<\-4\-4>
Select deinterlacing mode (default: \-3). Positive values choose mode
and enable deinterlacing. Corresponding negative values select the
same deinterlacing mode, but do not enable deinterlacing on startup
(useful in configuration files to specify what mode will be enabled by
the "D" key). All modes respect \fB\-\-field\-dominance\fP.

.TP
.B 3
motion adaptive temporal deinterlacing. May lead to A/V desync
with slow video hardware and/or high resolution.
.TP
.B 4
motion adaptive temporal deinterlacing with edge\-guided spatial
interpolation. Needs fast video hardware.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B chroma\-deint
Makes temporal deinterlacers operate both on luma and chroma (default).
Use no\-chroma\-deint to solely use luma and speed up advanced
deinterlacing. Useful with slow video memory.
.TP
.B pullup
Try to apply inverse telecine, needs motion adaptive temporal
deinterlacing.
.TP
.B hqscaling=<0\-9>
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B 0
Use default VDPAU scaling (default).
.TP
.B 1\-9
Apply high quality VDPAU scaling (needs capable hardware).
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B fps=<number>
Override autodetected display refresh rate value (the value is needed
for framedrop to allow video playback rates higher than display
refresh rate, and for vsync\-aware frame timing adjustments). Default 0
means use autodetected value. A positive value is interpreted as a
refresh rate in Hz and overrides the autodetected value. A negative
value disables all timing adjustment and framedrop logic.
.TP
.B composite\-detect
NVIDIA\(aqs current VDPAU implementation behaves somewhat differently
under a compositing window manager and does not give accurate frame
timing information. With this option enabled, the player tries to
detect whether a compositing window manager is active. If one is
detected, the player disables timing adjustments as if the user had
specified fps=\-1 (as they would be based on incorrect input). This
means timing is somewhat less accurate than without compositing, but
with the composited mode behavior of the NVIDIA driver there is no
hard playback speed limit even without the disabled logic. Enabled by
default, use no\-composite\-detect to disable.
.TP
.B queuetime_windowed=<number> and queuetime_fs=<number>
Use VDPAU\(aqs presentation queue functionality to queue future video
frame changes at most this many milliseconds in advance (default: 50).
See below for additional information.
.TP
.B output_surfaces=<2\-15>
Allocate this many output surfaces to display video frames (default:
3). See below for additional information.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Using the VDPAU frame queueing functionality controlled by the queuetime
options makes mpv\(aqs frame flip timing less sensitive to system CPU
load and allows mpv to start decoding the next frame(s) slightly
earlier which can reduce jitter caused by individual slow\-to\-decode
frames. However the NVIDIA graphics drivers can make other window behavior
such as window moves choppy if VDPAU is using the blit queue (mainly
happens if you have the composite extension enabled) and this feature is
active. If this happens on your system and it bothers you then you can set
the queuetime value to 0 to disable this feature. The settings to use in
windowed and fullscreen mode are separate because there should be less
reason to disable this for fullscreen mode (as the driver issue shouldn\(aqt
affect the video itself).
.sp
You can queue more frames ahead by increasing the queuetime values and the
output_surfaces count (to ensure enough surfaces to buffer video for a
certain time ahead you need at least as many surfaces as the video has
frames during that time, plus two). This could help make video smoother in
some cases. The main downsides are increased video RAM requirements for
the surfaces and laggier display response to user commands (display
changes only become visible some time after they\(aqre queued). The graphics
driver implementation may also have limits on the length of maximum
queuing time or number of queued surfaces that work well or at all.
.TP
.B direct3d_shaders (Windows only)
Video output driver that uses the Direct3D interface.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B prefer\-stretchrect
Use IDirect3DDevice9::StretchRect over other methods if possible.
.TP
.B disable\-stretchrect
Never render the video using IDirect3DDevice9::StretchRect.
.TP
.B disable\-textures
Never render the video using D3D texture rendering. (Rendering with
textures + shader will still be allowed. Add disable\-shaders to
completely disable video rendering with textures.)
.TP
.B disable\-shaders
Never use shaders when rendering video.
.TP
.B only\-8bit
Never render YUV video with more than 8 bits per component.
(Using this flag will force software conversion to 8 bit.)
.TP
.B disable\-texture\-align
Normally texture sizes are always aligned to 16. With this option
enabled, the video texture will always have exactly the same size as
the video itself.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

By default, it tries to use fast and fail\-safe settings. Use the alias
\fBopengl\-hq\fP to use this driver with defaults set to high quality
rendering.

.TP
.B sharpen5
Unsharp masking (sharpening) with radius=5 and a default strength
of 0.5 (see \fBlparam1\fP).
.TP
.B mitchell

.TP
.B stereo=<value>
Select a method for stereo display. You may have to use \fB\-\-aspect\fP to

.INDENT 7.0

.B 0
Normal 2D display
.TP
.B 1
Convert side by side input to full\-color red\-cyan stereo.
.TP

Convert side by side input to full\-color green\-magenta stereo.
.TP
.B 3
Convert side by side input to quadbuffered stereo. Only supported
by very few OpenGL cards.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B srgb
Enable gamma\-correct scaling by working in linear light. This
makes use of sRGB textures and framebuffers.
This option forces the options \(aqindirect\(aq and \(aqgamma\(aq.
NOTE: for YUV colorspaces, gamma 1/0.45 (2.222) is assumed. RGB input
is always assumed to be in sRGB.
This option is not really useful, as gamma\-correct scaling has not much
influence on typical video playback. Most visible effect comes from
slightly different gamma.
.TP
.B pbo
Enable use of PBOs. This is faster, but can sometimes lead to
sporadic and temporary image corruption.
.TP
.B dither\-depth=<N|no|auto>
Set dither target depth to N. Default: no.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B no
Disable any dithering done by mpv.
.TP
.B auto
Automatic selection. If output bit depth can\(aqt be detected,
8 bits per component are assumed.
.TP
.B 8
Dither to 8 bit output.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that the depth of the connected video display device can not be
detected. Often, LCD panels will do dithering on their own, which
conflicts with vo_opengl\(aqs dithering, and leads to ugly output.
.TP
.B debug
Check for OpenGL errors, i.e. call glGetError(). Also request a
debug OpenGL context (which does nothing with current graphics drivers
as of this writing).
.TP
.B swapinterval=<n>
Interval in displayed frames between two buffer swaps.
1 is equivalent to enable VSYNC, 0 to disable VSYNC.
.TP
.B no\-scale\-sep
When using a separable scale filter for luma, usually two filter
passes are done. This is often faster. However, it forces
conversion to RGB in an extra pass, so it can actually be slower
if used with fast filters on small screen resolutions. Using
this options will make rendering a single operation.
Note that chroma scalers are always done as 1\-pass filters.
.TP
.B cscale=<n>
As lscale but for chroma (2x slower with little visible effect).
Note that with some scaling filters, upscaling is always done in
RGB. If chroma is not subsampled, this option is ignored, and the
luma scaler is used instead. Setting this option is often useless.
.TP
.B fancy\-downscaling
When using convolution based filters, extend the filter size
when downscaling. Trades quality for reduced downscaling performance.
.TP
.B no\-npot
Force use of power\-of\-2 texture sizes. For debugging only.
Borders will be distorted due to filtering.
.TP
.B glfinish
Call glFinish() before swapping buffers

.UNINDENT
.TP
.B indirect
Do YUV conversion and scaling as separate passes. This will
first render the video into a video\-sized RGB texture, and
draw the result on screen. The luma scaler is used to scale
the RGB image when rendering to screen. The chroma scaler
is used only on YUV conversion, and only if the video is
chroma\-subsampled (usually the case).
This mechanism is disabled on RGB input.
Specifying this option directly is generally useful for debugging only.
.TP
.B fbo\-format=<fmt>
Selects the internal format of textures used for FBOs. The format can
influence performance and quality of the video output. (FBOs are not
always used, and typically only when using extended scalers.)
fmt can be one of: rgb, rgba, rgb8, rgb10, rgb16, rgb16f, rgb32f,
rgba12, rgba16, rgba16f, rgba32f.
Default: rgb.
.TP
.B gamma
Always enable gamma control. (Disables delayed enabling.)
.TP
.B icc\-profile=<file>
Load an ICC profile and use it to transform linear RGB to
screen output. Needs LittleCMS2 support compiled in.
.TP
.B icc\-cache=<file>
Store and load the 3D LUT created from the ICC profile in
this file. This can be used to speed up loading, since
LittleCMS2 can take a while to create the 3D LUT.
Note that this file contains an uncompressed LUT. Its size depends on
the \fB3dlut\-size\fP, and can be very big.

Size of the 3D LUT generated from the ICC profile in each
dimension. Default is 128x256x64.
Sizes must be a power of two, and 256 at most.
.TP
.B alpha
Try to create a framebuffer with alpha component. This only makes sense
if the video contains alpha information (which is extremely rare). May
not be supported on all platforms. If alpha framebuffers are
unavailable, it silently falls back to a normal framebuffer. Note
that when using FBO indirections (such as with \fBopengl\-hq\fP), a FBO
format with alpha must be specified with the \fBfbo\-format\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B opengl\-hq
Same as \fBopengl\fP, but with default settings for high quality rendering.
.sp
This is equivalent to:
.nf
\-\-vo=opengl:lscale=lanczos2:dither\-depth=auto:pbo:fbo\-format=rgb16
.fi
.sp
.sp
Note that some cheaper LCDs do dithering that gravely interferes with
vo_opengl\(aqs dithering. Disabling dithering with \fBdither\-depth=no\fP helps.
.sp
Unlike \fBopengl\fP, \fBopengl\-hq\fP makes use of FBOs by default. Sometimes you
can achieve better quality or performance by changing the fbo\-format
sub\-option to \fBrgb16f\fP, \fBrgb32f\fP or \fBrgb\fP. (Known problems include
Mesa/Intel not accepting \fBrgb16\fP, Mesa sometimes not being compiled with
float texture support, and some OSX setups being very slow with \fBrgb16\fP,
but fast with \fBrgb32f\fP.)
.TP
.B opengl\-old
OpenGL video output driver, old version. Video size must be smaller
than the maximum texture size of your OpenGL implementation. Intended to
work even with the most basic OpenGL implementations, but also makes use
of newer extensions, which allow support for more colorspaces.
.sp
The code performs very few checks, so if a feature does not work, this
might be because it is not supported by your card/OpenGL implementation
even if you do not get any error message. Use \fBglxinfo\fP or a similar
tool to display the supported OpenGL extensions.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B (no\-)ati\-hack
ATI drivers may give a corrupted image when PBOs are used (when using
\fIforce\-pbo\fP). This option fixes this, at the expense of
using a bit more memory.
.TP
.B (no\-)force\-pbo
Always uses PBOs to transfer textures even if this involves an extra
copy. Currently this gives a little extra speed with NVidia drivers
and a lot more speed with ATI drivers. May need
the ati\-hack suboption to work correctly.
.TP
.B (no\-)scaled\-osd
Changes the way the OSD behaves when the size of the window changes
(default: disabled). When enabled behaves more like the other video
output drivers, which is better for fixed\-size fonts. Disabled looks
much better with FreeType fonts and uses the borders in fullscreen
mode. Does not work correctly with ass subtitles (see \fB\-\-ass\fP), you
can instead render them without OpenGL support via \fB\-\-vf=ass\fP.
.TP
.B rectangle=<0,1,2>
Select usage of rectangular textures which saves video RAM, but often
is slower (default: 0).
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B 0
Use power\-of\-two textures (default).
.TP
.B 1
Use the \fBGL_ARB_texture_rectangle\fP extension.
.TP
.B 2
Use the \fBGL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two\fP extension. In some
cases only supported in software and thus very slow.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B swapinterval=<n>
Minimum interval between two buffer swaps, counted in displayed frames
(default: 1). 1 is equivalent to enabling VSYNC, 0 to disabling VSYNC.
Values below 0 will leave it at the system default. This limits the
framerate to (horizontal refresh rate / n). Requires
\fBGLX_SGI_swap_control\fP support to work. With some (most/all?)
implementations this only works in fullscreen mode.
.TP
.B ycbcr
Use the \fBGL_MESA_ycbcr_texture\fP extension to convert YUV to RGB. In
most cases this is probably slower than doing software conversion to
RGB.
.TP
.B yuv=<n>
Select the type of YUV to RGB conversion. The default is
auto\-detection deciding between values 0 and 2.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B 0
Use software conversion. Compatible with all OpenGL versions.
Provides brightness, contrast and saturation control.
.TP
.B 1
Same as 2. This used to use nVidia\-specific extensions, which
didn\(aqt provide any advantages over using fragment programs, except
possibly on very ancient graphic cards. It produced a gray\-ish
output, which is why it has been removed.
.TP
.B 2
Use a fragment program. Needs the \fBGL_ARB_fragment_program\fP
extension and at least three texture units. Provides brightness,
contrast, saturation and hue control.
.TP
.B 3
Use a fragment program using the POW instruction. Needs the
\fBGL_ARB_fragment_program\fP extension and at least three texture
units. Provides brightness, contrast, saturation, hue and gamma
control. Gamma can also be set independently for red, green and
blue. Method 4 is usually faster.
.TP
.B 4
Use a fragment program with additional lookup. Needs the
\fBGL_ARB_fragment_program\fP extension and at least four texture
units. Provides brightness, contrast, saturation, hue and gamma
control. Gamma can also be set independently for red, green and
blue.
.TP
.B 5
Use ATI\-specific method (for older cards). This uses an
ATI\-specific extension (\fBGL_ATI_fragment_shader\fP \- not
\fBGL_ARB_fragment_shader\fP!). At least three texture units are
needed. Provides saturation and hue control. This method is fast
but inexact.
.TP
.B 6
Use a 3D texture to do conversion via lookup. Needs the
\fBGL_ARB_fragment_program extension\fP and at least four texture
units. Extremely slow (software emulation) on some (all?) ATI
cards since it uses a texture with border pixels. Provides
brightness, contrast, saturation, hue and gamma control. Gamma can
also be set independently for red, green and blue. Speed depends
more on GPU memory bandwidth than other methods.

.TP
.B 2
Use cubic filtering in horizontal, linear filtering in vertical
direction. Works on a few more cards than method 1.

.B lavcac3enc[=tospdif[:bitrate[:minchn]]]
Encode multi\-channel audio to AC\-3 at runtime using libavcodec. Supports
16\-bit native\-endian input format, maximum 6 channels. The output is
big\-endian when outputting a raw AC\-3 stream, native\-endian when
outputting to S/PDIF. The output sample rate of this filter is same with
the input sample rate. When input sample rate is 48kHz, 44.1kHz, or 32kHz,
this filter directly use it. Otherwise a resampling filter is
auto\-inserted before this filter to make the input and output sample rate
be 48kHz. You need to specify \fB\-\-channels=N\fP to make the decoder decode
audio into N\-channel, then the filter can encode the N\-channel input to

If the sample rate of the sound being played is lower than the center
frequency for a frequency band, then that band will be disabled. A known
bug with this filter is that the characteristics for the uppermost band
are not completely symmetric if the sample rate is close to the center
frequency of that band. This problem can be worked around by upsampling
the sound using the resample filter before it reaches this filter.

the number of output channels is bigger than the number of input channels
empty channels are inserted (except mixing from mono to stereo, then the

.B volume[=v[:sc[:fast]]]
Implements software volume control. Use this filter with caution since it
can reduce the signal to noise ratio of the sound. In most cases it is
best to set the level for the PCM sound to max, leave this filter out and
control the output level to your speakers with the master volume control
of the mixer. In case your sound card has a digital PCM mixer instead of
an analog one, and you hear distortion, use the MASTER mixer instead. If
there is an external amplifier connected to the computer (this is almost
always the case), the noise level can be minimized by adjusting the master
level and the volume knob on the amplifier until the hissing noise in the
background is gone.
.sp
This filter has a second feature: It measures the overall maximum sound
level and prints out that level when mpv exits. This feature currently
only works with floating\-point data.

.B <v>
Sets the desired gain in dB for all channels in the stream from \-200dB

gain of 1000 (default: 0).
.TP
.B <sc>
Turns soft clipping on (1) or off (0). Soft\-clipping can make the
sound more smooth if very high volume levels are used. Enable this
option if the dynamic range of the loudspeakers is very low.

Mixes channels arbitrarily. Basically a combination of the volume and the

e.g. stereo to mono or vary the "width" of the center speaker in a
surround sound system. This filter is hard to use, and will require some
tinkering before the desired result is obtained. The number of options for

.B sub[=fc:ch]
Adds a subwoofer channel to the audio stream. The audio data used for
creating the subwoofer channel is an average of the sound in channel 0 and
channel 1. The resulting sound is then low\-pass filtered by a 4th order
Butterworth filter with a default cutoff frequency of 60Hz and added to a
separate channel in the audio stream.

Third\-generation pulldown reversal (inverse telecine) filter, capable of
handling mixed hard\-telecine, 24000/1001 fps progressive, and 30000/1001
fps progressive content. The pullup filter is designed to be much more
robust than detc or ivtc, by taking advantage of future context in making
its decisions. Like ivtc, pullup is stateless in the sense that it does
not lock onto a pattern to follow, but it instead looks forward to the
following fields in order to identify matches and rebuild progressive
frames. It is still under development, but believed to be quite accurate.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B jl, jr, jt, and jb
These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right,
top, and bottom of the image, respectively. Left/right are in units of
8 pixels, while top/bottom are in units of 2 lines. The default is 8
pixels on each side.
.TP
.B sb (strict breaks)
Setting this option to 1 will reduce the chances of pullup generating
an occasional mismatched frame, but it may also cause an excessive
number of frames to be dropped during high motion sequences.
Conversely, setting it to \-1 will make pullup match fields more
easily. This may help processing of video where there is slight
blurring between the fields, but may also cause there to be interlaced
frames in the output.
.TP
.B mp (metric plane)
This option may be set to 1 or 2 to use a chroma plane instead of the
luma plane for doing pullup\(aqs computations. This may improve accuracy
on very clean source material, but more likely will decrease accuracy,
especially if there is chroma noise (rainbow effect) or any grayscale
video. The main purpose of setting mp to a chroma plane is to reduce
CPU load and make pullup usable in realtime on slow machines.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B divtc[=options]
Inverse telecine for deinterlaced video. If 3:2\-pulldown telecined video
has lost one of the fields or is deinterlaced using a method that keeps
one field and interpolates the other, the result is a juddering video that
has every fourth frame duplicated. This filter is intended to find and
drop those duplicates and restore the original film framerate. Two
different modes are available: One pass mode is the default and is
straightforward to use, but has the disadvantage that any changes in the
telecine phase (lost frames or bad edits) cause momentary judder until the
filter can resync again. Two pass mode avoids this by analyzing the whole
video beforehand so it will have forward knowledge about the phase changes
and can resync at the exact spot. These passes do \fInot\fP correspond to pass
one and two of the encoding process. You must run an extra pass using
divtc pass one before the actual encoding throwing the resulting video
away. Then use divtc pass two for the actual
encoding. If you use multiple encoder passes, use divtc pass two for all
of them. The options are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B pass=1|2
Use two pass mode.
.TP
.B file=<filename>
Set the two pass log filename (default: \fBframediff.log\fP).
.TP
.B threshold=<value>
Set the minimum strength the telecine pattern must have for the filter
to believe in it (default: 0.5). This is used to avoid recognizing
false pattern from the parts of the video that are very dark or very
still.
.TP
.B window=<numframes>
Set the number of past frames to look at when searching for pattern
(default: 30). Longer window improves the reliability of the pattern
search, but shorter window improves the reaction time to the changes
in the telecine phase. This only affects the one pass mode. The two
pass mode currently uses fixed window that extends to both future and
past.
.TP
.B phase=0|1|2|3|4
Sets the initial telecine phase for one pass mode (default: 0). The
two pass mode can see the future, so it is able to use the correct
phase from the beginning, but one pass mode can only guess. It catches
the correct phase when it finds it, but this option can be used to fix
the possible juddering at the beginning. The first pass of the two
pass mode also uses this, so if you save the output from the first
pass, you get constant phase result.
.TP
.B deghost=<value>
Set the deghosting threshold (0\-255 for one pass mode, \-255\-255 for
two pass mode, default 0). If nonzero, deghosting mode is used. This
is for video that has been deinterlaced by blending the fields
together instead of dropping one of the fields. Deghosting amplifies
any compression artifacts in the blended frames, so the parameter
value is used as a threshold to exclude those pixels from deghosting
that differ from the previous frame less than specified value. If two
pass mode is used, then negative value can be used to make the filter
analyze the whole video in the beginning of pass\-2 to determine
whether it needs deghosting or not and then select either zero or the
absolute value of the parameter. Specify this option for pass\-2, it
makes no difference on pass\-1.

.B phase[=t|b|p|a|u|T|B|A|U][:v]
Delay interlaced video by one field time so that the field order changes.
The intended use is to fix PAL movies that have been captured with the
opposite field order to the film\-to\-video transfer. The options are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B t
Capture field order top\-first, transfer bottom\-first. Filter will
delay the bottom field.
.TP
.B b
Capture bottom\-first, transfer top\-first. Filter will delay the top
field.
.TP
.B p
Capture and transfer with the same field order. This mode only exists
for the documentation of the other options to refer to, but if you
actually select it, the filter will faithfully do nothing ;\-)
.TP
.B a
Capture field order determined automatically by field flags, transfer
opposite. Filter selects among t and b modes on a frame by frame basis
using field flags. If no field information is available, then this
works just like u.
.TP
.B u
Capture unknown or varying, transfer opposite. Filter selects among t
and b on a frame by frame basis by analyzing the images and selecting
the alternative that produces best match between the fields.
.TP
.B T
Capture top\-first, transfer unknown or varying. Filter selects among t
and p using image analysis.
.TP
.B B
Capture bottom\-first, transfer unknown or varying. Filter selects
among b and p using image analysis.
.TP
.B A
Capture determined by field flags, transfer unknown or varying. Filter
selects among t, b and p using field flags and image analysis. If no
field information is available, then this works just like U. This is
the default mode.
.TP
.B U
Both capture and transfer unknown or varying. Filter selects among t,
b and p using image analysis only.
.TP
.B v
Verbose operation. Prints the selected mode for each frame and the
average squared difference between fields for t, b, and p
alternatives.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B yadif=[mode[:enabled=yes|no]]
Yet another deinterlacing filter
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B <mode>
.INDENT 7.0
.TP

.B <enabled>
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B yes
Filter is active (default).

.UNINDENT
.TP
.B delogo[=x:y:w:h:t]
Suppresses a TV station logo by a simple interpolation of the surrounding
pixels. Just set a rectangle covering the logo and watch it disappear (and
sometimes something even uglier appear \- your mileage may vary).
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B <x>,<y>
top left corner of the logo
.TP
.B <w>,<h>
width and height of the cleared rectangle
.TP
.B <t>
Thickness of the fuzzy edge of the rectangle (added to w and h). When
set to \-1, a green rectangle is drawn on the screen to simplify
finding the right x,y,w,h parameters.
.TP
.B file=<file>
You can specify a text file to load the coordinates from.  Each line
must have a timestamp (in seconds, and in ascending order) and the
"x:y:w:h:t" coordinates (\fIt\fP can be omitted).
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B screenshot
Optional filter for screenshot support. This is only needed if the video
output doesn\(aqt provide working direct screenshot support. Note that it is
not always safe to insert this filter by default. See the
\fBTaking screenshots\fP section for details.
.TP
.B sub=[=bottom\-margin:top\-margin]
Moves subtitle rendering to an arbitrary point in the filter
chain, or force subtitle rendering in the video filter as opposed to using
video output OSD support.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B <bottom\-margin>
Adds a black band at the bottom of the frame. The SSA/ASS renderer can
place subtitles there (with \fB\-\-ass\-use\-margins\fP).
.TP
.B <top\-margin>
Black band on the top for toptitles  (with \fB\-\-ass\-use\-margins\fP).
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIEXAMPLE\fP:

.TP
.B gradfun[=strength[:radius]]
Fix the banding artifacts that are sometimes introduced into nearly flat
regions by truncation to 8bit colordepth. Interpolates the gradients that
should go where the bands are, and dithers them.
.sp
This filter is designed for playback only. Do not use it prior to lossy
compression, because compression tends to lose the dither and bring back
the bands.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B <strength>
Maximum amount by which the filter will change any one pixel. Also the
threshold for detecting nearly flat regions (default: 1.2).
.TP
.B <radius>
Neighborhood to fit the gradient to. Larger radius makes for smoother
gradients, but also prevents the filter from modifying pixels near
detailed regions (default: 16).
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B dlopen=dll[:a0[:a1[:a2[:a3]]]]
Loads an external library to filter the image. The library interface
is the vf_dlopen interface specified using libmpcodecs/vf_dlopen.h.

.SH ENCODING
.sp
You can encode files from one format/codec to another using this facility.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-o \ <filename>
Enables encoding mode and specifies the output file name.
.TP
.BI \-\-of\fB= <format>
Specifies the output format (overrides autodetection by the extension of
the file specified by \-o). This can be a comma separated list of possible
formats to try. See \-\-of=help for a full list of supported formats.
.TP
.BI \-\-ofopts\fB= <options>
Specifies the output format options for libavformat.
See \-\-ofopts=help for a full list of supported options.
.sp
Options are managed in lists. There are a few commands to manage the
options list.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.BI \-\-ofopts\-add\fB= <options1[,options2,...]>
Appends the options given as arguments to the options list.
.TP
.BI \-\-ofopts\-pre\fB= <options1[,options2,...]>
Prepends the options given as arguments to the options list.
.TP
.BI \-\-ofopts\-del\fB= <index1[,index2,...]>
Deletes the options at the given indexes. Index numbers start at 0,
negative numbers address the end of the list (\-1 is the last).
.TP
.B \-\-ofopts\-clr
Completely empties the options list.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.BI \-\-ofps\fB= <float value>
Specifies the output format time base (default: 24000). Low values like 25
limit video fps by dropping frames.
.TP
.B \-\-oautofps
Sets the output format time base to the guessed frame rate of the input
video (simulates mencoder behaviour, useful for AVI; may cause frame
drops). Note that not all codecs and not all formats support VFR
encoding, and some which do have bugs when a target bitrate is
specified \- use \-\-ofps or \-\-oautofps to force CFR encoding in these
cases.
.TP
.B \-\-oharddup
If set, the frame rate given by \-\-ofps is attained not by skipping time
codes, but by duplicating frames (constant frame rate mode).
.TP
.B \-\-oneverdrop
If set, frames are never dropped. Instead, time codes of video are
readjusted to always increase. This may cause AV desync, though; to
work around this, use a high\-fps time base using \-\-ofps and absolutely
avoid \-\-oautofps.
.TP
.BI \-\-oac\fB= <codec>
Specifies the output audio codec. This can be a comma separated list of
possible codecs to try. See \-\-oac=help for a full list of supported codecs.
.TP
.BI \-\-oaoffset\fB= <value>
Shifts audio data by the given time (in seconds) by adding/removing
samples at the start.
.TP
.BI \-\-oacopts\fB= <options>
Specifies the output audio codec options for libavcodec.
See \-\-oacopts=help for a full list of supported options.
.sp
EXAMPLE: "\-\-oac=libmp3lame \-\-oacopts=b=128000" selects 128kbps MP3
encoding.

Deletes the options at the given indexes. Index numbers start at 0,
negative numbers address the end of the list (\-1 is the last).
.TP
.B \-\-oacopts\-clr
Completely empties the options list.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \-\-oafirst
Force the audio stream to become the first stream in the output. By default
the order is unspecified.

.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \-\-ovfirst
Force the video stream to become the first stream in the output. By default
the order is unspecified.
.TP
.B \-\-ocopyts
Copies input pts to the output video (not supported by some output
container formats, e.g. avi). Discontinuities are still fixed.
By default, audio pts are set to playback time and video pts are
synchronized to match audio pts, as some output formats do not support
anything else.
.TP
.B \-\-orawts
Copies input pts to the output video (not supported by some output
container formats, e.g. avi). In this modem discontinuities are not fixed
and all pts are passed through as\-is. Never seek backwards or use multiple
input files in this mode!
.UNINDENT
.SH INPUT.CONF
.sp
The input.conf file consists of a list of key bindings, for example:
.nf
s screenshot      # take a screenshot with the s key
.fi
.sp
.sp
Each line maps a key to an input command. Keys are specified with their literal
value (upper case if combined with \fBShift\fP), or a name for special keys. For
example, \fBa\fP maps to the \fBa\fP key without shift, and \fBA\fP maps to \fBa\fP
with shift.
.sp
A list of special keys can be obtained with
.nf
\fBmpv\fP \-\-input\-keylist
.fi
.sp
.sp
In general, keys can be combined with \fBShift\fP, \fBCtrl\fP and \fBAlt\fP:
.nf
ctrl+q quit
.fi
.sp
.sp
\fBmpv\fP can be started in input test mode, which displays key bindings and the
commands they\(aqre bound to on the OSD, instead of running the commands:
.nf
\fBmpv\fP \-\-input\-test \-\-demuxer=rawvideo \-\-rawvideo=w=1280:h=720 /dev/zero
.fi
.sp
.sp
(Commands which normally close the player will not work in this mode, and you
must kill \fBmpv\fP externally to make it exit.)
.SS General input command syntax
.sp
\fI[Shift+][Ctrl+][Alt+][Meta+]<key> [<prefixes>] <command> (<argument>)*\fP
.sp
Newlines always start a new binding. \fB#\fP starts a comment (outside of quoted
string arguments). To bind commands to the \fB#\fP key, \fBSHARP\fP can be used.
.sp
<key> is either the literal character the key produces (ASCII or unicode
character), or a symbol name.
.sp
Arguments are separated by whitespace. This applies even to string arguments.
For this reason, string arguments should be quoted with \fB"\fP. Inside quotes,
C style escaping can be used.
.sp
Optional arguments can be skipped with \fB\-\fP.
.SS List of input commands
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B ignore
Use this to "block" keys that should be unbound, and do nothing. Useful for
disabling default bindings, without disabling all bindings with
\fB\-\-no\-input\-default\-bindings\fP.
.TP
.B seek <seconds> [relative|absolute|absolute\-percent|\- [default\-precise|exact|keyframes]]
Change the playback position. By default, seeks by a relative amount of
seconds.
.sp
The second argument sets the seek mode:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B relative (default)
Seek relative to current position (a negative value seeks backwards).
.TP
.B absolute
Seek to a given time.
.TP
.B absolute\-percent
Seek to a given percent position.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The third argument defines how exact the seek is:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B default\-precise (default)
Follow the default behavior as set by \fB\-\-hr\-seek\fP, which by default
does imprecise seeks (like \fBkeyframes\fP).
.TP
.B exact
Always do exact/hr/precise seeks (slow).
.TP
.B keyframes
Always restart playback at keyframe boundaries (fast).
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B frame_step
Play one frame, then pause.
.TP
.B frame_back_step
Go back by one frame, then pause. Note that this can be very slow (it tries
to be precise, not fast), and sometimes fails to behave as expected. How
well this works depends on whether precise seeking works correctly (e.g.
see the \fB\-\-hr\-seek\-demuxer\-offset\fP option). Video filters or other video
postprocessing that modifies timing of frames (e.g. deinterlacing) should
usually work, but might make backstepping silently behave incorrectly in
corner cases.
.sp
This doesn\(aqt work with audio\-only playback.
.TP
.B set <property> "<value>"
Set the given property to the given value.
.TP
.B add <property> [<value>]
Add the given value to the property. On overflow or underflow, clamp the
property to the maximum. If <value> is omitted, assume \fB1\fP.
.TP
.B cycle <property> [up|down]
Cycle the given property. \fBup\fP and \fBdown\fP set the cycle direction. On
overflow, set the property back to the minimum, on underflow set it to the
maximum. If \fBup\fP or \fBdown\fP is omitted, assume \fBup\fP.
.TP
.B speed_mult <value>
Multiply the \fBspeed\fP property by the given value.
.TP
.B screenshot [subtitles|video|window|\- [single|each\-frame]]
Take a screenshot.
.sp
First argument:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B <subtitles> (default)
Save the video image, in its original resolution, and with subtitles.
Some video outputs may still include the OSD in the output under certain
circumstances.
.TP
.B <video>
Like \fBsubtitles\fP, but typically without OSD or subtitles. The exact
behavior depends on the selected video output.
.TP
.B <window>
Save the contents of the mpv window. Typically scaled, with OSD and
subtitles. The exact behavior depends on the selected video output, and
if no support is available, this will act like \fBvideo\fP.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Second argument:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B <single> (default)
Take a single screenshot.
.TP
.B <each\-frame>

.sp
<duration> is the time in ms to show the message. By default, it uses the
same value as \fB\-\-osd\-duration\fP.
.sp
<level> is the minimum OSD level to show the text (see \fB\-\-osd\-level\fP).

.SS Properties
.sp
Properties are used to set mpv options during runtime, or to query arbitrary
information. They can be manipulated with the \fBset\fP/\fBadd\fP/\fBcycle\fP
commands, and retrieved with \fBshow_text\fP, or anything else that uses property
expansion. (See \fB\-\-playing\-msg\fP how properties are expanded.)
.sp
\fBW\fP indicates whether the property is generally writeable. If an option
is referenced, the property should take/return exactly the same values as the
option.

.SH TAKING SCREENSHOTS
.sp
Screenshots of the currently played file can be taken using the \(aqscreenshot\(aq
input mode command, which is by default bound to the \fBs\fP key. Files named
\fBshotNNNN.jpg\fP will be saved in the working directory, using the first
available number \- no files will be overwritten.
.sp
A screenshot will usually contain the unscaled video contents at the end of the
video filter chain and subtitles. By default the \fBS\fP takes screenshots without
subtitles, while \fBs\fP includes subtitles.
.sp
The \fBscreenshot\fP video filter is not required when using a recommended GUI
video output driver. It should normally not be added to the config file, as
taking screenshots is handled by the VOs, and adding the screenshot filter will
break hardware decoding. (The filter may still be useful for taking screenshots
at a certain point within the video chain when using multiple video filters.)
.SH CHANGES FROM OTHER VERSIONS OF MPLAYER
.sp
\fBmpv\fP is based on mplayer2, which in turn is based on the original
MPlayer (also called mplayer, mplayer\-svn, mplayer1). Many changes
have been made. Some changes are incompatible, or completely change how the
player behaves.

.SS Detailed listing of user\-visible changes
.sp
This listing is about changed command line switches, slave commands, and similar
things. Completely removed features are not listed.
.SS Command line switches
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
There is a new command line syntax, which is generally preferred over the old
syntax. \fB\-optname optvalue\fP becomes \fB\-\-optname=optvalue\fP.
.sp
The old syntax will not be removed in the near future. However, the new
syntax is mentioned in all documentation and so on, so it\(aqs a good thing to
know about this change.
.sp
(The new syntax was introduced in mplayer2.)
.IP \(bu 2
In general, negating switches like \fB\-noopt\fP now have to be written as
\fB\-no\-opt\fP, or better \fB\-\-no\-opt\fP.
.IP \(bu 2
Per\-file options are not the default anymore. You can explicitly specify
file local options. See \fBUsage\fP section.

.IP \(bu 2
The playtree has been removed. \fBmpv\fP\(aqs internal playlist is a simple and
flat list now. This makes the code easier, and makes \fBmpv\fP usage less
confusing.
.IP \(bu 2
Slave mode is broken. This mode is entirely insane in the \fBold\fP versions of
mplayer. A proper slave mode application needed tons of code and hacks to get
it right. The main problem is that slave mode is a bad and incomplete
interface, and to get around that, applications parsed output messages
intended for users. It\(aqs hard to know which messages exactly are parsed by
slave mode applications. This makes it virtually impossible to improve
terminal output intended for users without possibly breaking something.
.sp
This is absolutely insane, and \fBmpv\fP will not try to keep slave mode
compatible. If you\(aqre a developer of a slave mode application, contact us,
and a new and better protocol can be developed.
.UNINDENT
.SS Policy for removed features
.sp
Features are a good thing, because they make users happy. As such, it is
attempted to preserve useful features as far as possible. But if a feature is
likely to be not used by many, and causes problems otherwise, it will be
removed. Developers should not be burdened with fixing or cleaning up code that
has no actual use.
.sp
It\(aqs always possible to add back removed features. File a feature request if a
feature you relied on was removed, and you want it back. Though it might be
rejected in the worst case, it\(aqs much more likely that it will be either added
back, or that a better solution will be implemented.
.SS Why this fork?
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
mplayer\-svn wants to maintain old code, even if it\(aqs very bad code. It seems
mplayer2 was forked, because mplayer\-svn developers refused to get rid of
all the cruft. The mplayer2 and mplayer\-svn codebases also deviated enough to
make a reunification unlikely.
.IP \(bu 2
mplayer2 development is slow, and it\(aqs hard to get in changes. Details
withheld as to not turn this into a rant.
.IP \(bu 2
mplayer\-svn rarely merged from mplayer2, and mplayer2 practically stopped
merging from mplayer\-svn (not even code cleanups or new features are merged)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmpv\fP intents to continuously merge from mplayer\-svn and mplayer2, while
speeding up development. There is willingness for significant changes, even
if this means breaking compatibility.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
There are a number of environment variables that can be used to control the
behavior of mpv.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBMPV_HOME\fP
Directory where mpv looks for user settings.
.TP
.B \fBMPV_LOCALEDIR\fP
Directory where mpv looks for gettext translation files (if enabled).
.TP
.B \fBMPV_VERBOSE\fP (see also \fB\-v\fP and \fB\-\-msglevel\fP)
Set the initial verbosity level across all message modules (default: 0).
The resulting verbosity corresponds to that of \fB\-\-msglevel=5\fP plus the
value of \fBMPV_VERBOSE\fP.
.TP
.B libaf:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBLADSPA_PATH\fP
If \fBLADSPA_PATH\fP is set, it searches for the specified file. If it
is not set, you must supply a fully specified pathname.
.sp
FIXME: This is also mentioned in the ladspa section.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B libdvdcss:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBDVDCSS_CACHE\fP
Specify a directory in which to store title key values. This will
speed up descrambling of DVDs which are in the cache. The
\fBDVDCSS_CACHE\fP directory is created if it does not exist, and a
subdirectory is created named after the DVD\(aqs title or manufacturing
date. If \fBDVDCSS_CACHE\fP is not set or is empty, libdvdcss will use
the default value which is \fB${HOME}/.dvdcss/\fP under Unix and
\fBC:\eDocuments and Settings\e$USER\eApplication Data\edvdcss\e\fP under
Win32. The special value "off" disables caching.
.TP
.B \fBDVDCSS_METHOD\fP
Sets the authentication and decryption method that libdvdcss will use
to read scrambled discs. Can be one of title, key or disc.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B key
is the default method. libdvdcss will use a set of calculated
player keys to try and get the disc key. This can fail if the drive
does not recognize any of the player keys.
.TP
.B disc
is a fallback method when key has failed. Instead of using player
keys, libdvdcss will crack the disc key using a brute force
algorithm. This process is CPU intensive and requires 64 MB of
memory to store temporary data.
.TP
.B title
is the fallback when all other methods have failed. It does not
rely on a key exchange with the DVD drive, but rather uses a crypto
attack to guess the title key. On rare cases this may fail because
there is not enough encrypted data on the disc to perform a
statistical attack, but on the other hand it is the only way to
decrypt a DVD stored on a hard disc, or a DVD with the wrong region
on an RPC2 drive.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBDVDCSS_RAW_DEVICE\fP
Specify the raw device to use. Exact usage will depend on your
operating system, the Linux utility to set up raw devices is raw(8)
for instance. Please note that on most operating systems, using a raw
device requires highly aligned buffers: Linux requires a 2048 bytes
alignment (which is the size of a DVD sector).
.TP
.B \fBDVDCSS_VERBOSE\fP
Sets the libdvdcss verbosity level.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B 0
Outputs no messages at all.
